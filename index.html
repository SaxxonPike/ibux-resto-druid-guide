                                Healer stat weights are ever-changing based on the fight and everything happening. Plan
                                your gear for the fight duration/damage output. Using a one size fits all stat value is
                                a bad idea for a healer. More mana or mana per 5 seconds is useless if you don't consume
                                that mana, for example.</p>
                            <p>In general, stacking healing and downranking is more mana per 5 seconds than actually
                                most mana per 5 seconds gear choices. If you don't have enough mana and go out of mana
                                before the end of fights, use more consumes and/or downrank your spells more. If you want
                                to downrank but can't, you have to stack mana per 5 seconds. If you want to uprank but
                                can't, you need to stack +healing, regardless of your weights. Stacking healing and
                                downranking multiplicatively increases the value of your mana potions, runes, and
                                passive mana per 5 seconds. Mana per 5 seconds is good on speed runs where you never
                                leave combat and can't drink.</p>

                                divided by 3,5 (Bonus Heal*(Cast Time/3,5). This penalty is calculated before talent
                                reduce, so Improved Healing Touch does not affect this penalty. Spells learned below
                                level 20 suffers from a penalty that is calculated by the following formula: 1 - ((20 -
                                lvl) * 0,0375) (lvl = Level that the spell is acquired). So for rank 1, the penalty
                                would be 1-((20-1)*0,0375) = 0,2875. Like the Cast Time Penalty, this does not affect
                                the base heal, but the bonus healing added to the basic spell.</p>

                            <p>This deep resto build gives the druid an extra large instant heal every 15 second, making
                                the druid one of the strongest tank healers in the game ready to top off any spike
                                damage in a flash. It’s important to manage and track your own heal over time spells
                                because it can become very inefficient to consume another druid’s low ranked heal over
                                time spells instead of your own max ranked heals over time spells. This build goes back
                                to prioritizing +healing since healing touch will be the most cast spell between heals
                                over time spells and Swiftmend cooldowns. Swiftmend is less mana efficient than Moonglow
                                but more heal per second, and it is more mana efficient than Regrowth but will put up
                                less heal per second. Swiftmend is also the strongest resto player vs. player build, a
                                good Swiftmend druid is virtually unkillable. This makes this build very enticing to any
                                druid who does not want to respec every week to do player vs. player between raids.</p>

                                with predictive spike damage. If you can precast big heals that go off right after your
                                target takes large spike damage then you’ll truly shine. Topping off raid damage tends
                                to be feel really slow in comparison to regrowth built druids, or any other healing
                                class. Moonglow druids tend to run the most +healing and can afford the mana for max

                                This is a very interesting build because most people wouldn't think that you could be a
                                tank and a healer at the same time. But actually you can with this build. The reason is
                                that for better or worse, there's not a lot of strong talents in the restoration tree.
                                Remember the moonglow build? we put 20 points into that just to get two talents that we
                                cared about. Generally the same thing is happening here. As a healer you will be
                                spamming Healing Touch and Rejuvenations. As a tank you have virtually all important

                                right, just reapply rejuvenation on the tanks and continue healing. It’s more mana
                                intensive than it sounds. Swiftmend is efficient but keeping rejuvenation up is
                                expensive. You usually do it for 1-2 tanks, if there are 3 or more tanks only use
                                rejuvenation on 1-2 at a time. Don’t use regrowth on tanks. The chance swiftmend eats it
                                is not worth having it up. Swiftmend -&gt; Healing Touch -&gt; Rejuvenation lines up

                                taking high amounts of damage. Being able to predict incoming damage and pre casting is
                                not easy, at first but become better with experience. Raid heal with Healing Touch rank
                                2-3 when there is minimal raid damage. Heal with Healing Touch rank 4 when there is
                                mediocre raid damage.</p>
                            <p>In low level dungeons it’s often best to just use a well-timed max rank Healing Touch to

                                Using rank 6 and equipping 8 pieces tier 2 provides at least +100 healing per second

                            <p><strong>Prevent heals being sniped</strong><br>
                                The best way to prevent your heals being sniped is to change to a more proactive play
                                style. You need to predict damage before it comes out and start precasting for it. This
                                also means you should get used to using a stop cast macro, to prevent overhealing if
                                that predictive damage never comes. Also, ensure you and your fellow guild mates all
                                have a healcomm addon that will show all incoming heals on raid frames.</p>
                            <p>Knowing when to expect damage is important. Almost everything has 2.5 seconds swing
                                timer, and then add mechanics that might do damage. So if your assigned tank takes a hit
                                you know he's most likely getting hit again in 2.5 seconds, so you queue a heal to hit
                                for that. Healing assignments are also important. Not assigning healers will just end up
                                with more heal sniping.</p>
                            <p>You could also end up having too many healers for the content. If that is the case, then
                                some healers could go deal damage for those parts of the raid, and just swap back to
                                healing when more healing is needed.</p>
                            <p><strong>"Tank heal" vs "Raid heal"</strong><br>
                                Assign a few healers to tanks, but the expectation is your expected to prioritize you
                                tank first, but still heal everyone when needed. In a 40-man raid healers need to be
                                flexible.</p>
